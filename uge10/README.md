specifically the javascript in ->my-handin-folder\uge10\SPAExcersise1\src
and index.html in ->my-handin-folder\uge10\SPAExcersise1\public


### Task 4
-completed 95%
This is a really long task
Backend used was "code_jsonserver_with_errors.git" startcode which is the ->my-handin-folder\uge10\SPAExcersise4 folder-

The frontend is ->my-handin-folder\uge10\SPAExcersise4Frontend folder 
specifically the javascript in /src and index.html in /public

i got post,get,delete method fetching working (can be seen in the javascript)

i did not get the error handling working properly, i could only get it to console log a message. therefore the 95% done

# --------Thursday---------------

## Opgave CORS and Hosting

#Task 1
-Not completed
i could not get the API to work in postman. therefore i never made a frontend. i could never get a response in postman to my requests. 
even tried to use the jpa-rest-devops startcode to use as the backend.

i realise now that i may have been trying the call on the wrong port... but i used my whole saturday and ive given up on this assignment. 

# --------Friday---------------
Did not complete any friday assignments as i struggled with wednesday and thursday excersises
